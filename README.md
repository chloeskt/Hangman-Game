# Hangman Game

In this little projet, I used pygame to design the famous hangman game. \
The game is in english and uses the whole dictionnary (download thanks to nltk). If you want to use it in another language, you just need to change the initial `nltk.corpus`. \
It runs with python3.8, you just need to run the `hangman.py` script.
